    "- Consider now a cascade of two stages. Compute the optimal number of membrane modules and their arrangement in stages in order to achieve the specifics required. Compute all the concentrations and volumetric flows in your process configuration of choice.  Define clearly your chosen criterion for optimality.\n"
