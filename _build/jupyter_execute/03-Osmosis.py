# # 3. On the thermodynamic origin of the osmotic pressure

# ## 3.1 Osmosis

# Osmosis is a mass transfer process that takes place spontaneously when two compartments, containing fluid mixtures of different composition are separated by a semipermeable membrane, i.e. a membrane that restricts the transfer of one of the components across compartments. 
# 
# For the sake of simplicity, let us consider for now an ideal semipermeable membrane that completely restricts the transfer of the solute, while instead allowing the permeation of a solvent.
# 
# Let us consider an initial state characterised by two compartments (1 and 2), at the same temperature T and pressure P. 
# Compartment 1 contains a binary mixture of component B (solute) in component A (solvent), e.g. NaCl in water. Compartment 2 instead contains a pure component A (e.g. pure water).
# 
# If the membrane is semipermeable and allows for the passage of the solvent alone the process of osmosis will lead to an equilibrium condition in which: 
# 
# - Component A has transferred from compartment 2 to compartment 1. 
# - An pressure difference between compartments is established, where : $P_1>P_2$.
# - The pressure difference between compartments at equilibrium is the _osmotic pressure_ $\pi=P_1-P_2$.
# 
# In the next paragraphs we will see what is the thermodynamic origin of the osmotic pressure. 
# 

# ## 3.2 Equilibrium Conditions

# In order to understand the origin of the osmotic pressure, i.e. pressure difference induced by a composition difference across compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane, we begin by defining the the equilibrium state for the system described in the previous paragraph.
# To this aim we can rely on the thermodynamic definition of equilibrium for component A (e.g. water), i.e. the only component that can transfer across the membrane. 
# Equilibrium is defined when $A$ has the same chemical potential in both compartments
# 
# $$
# \mu_{A,1}=\mu_{A,2}
# $$(eq0)
# 
# The equilibrium condition is conveniently written introducing fugacity. 
# Fugacity and chemical potential are related by the expression $\mu_i=\mu_0+RT\ln{f_i}$, where $\mu_0$ is the chemical potential of an arbitrary reference state. 
# 
# Equilibrium can conditions are thus equivalently formulated as: 
# 
# $$
# f_{A,1}=f_{A,2}
# $$(eq:Equilibrium)
# 
# _In compartment 1_ we have a _non-ideal_ mixture of two components. The fugacity of component A in compartment 1 is thus written as: 
# $$
# f_{A,1}=f_A(T,P_1,x_A)=\gamma_A(T,P_1,x_A)x_A f_A(T,P_1)
# $$(eq:leftside)
# 
# where: 
# - $\gamma_A(T,P_1,x_A)$ is the activity coefficient of specie A in the mixture
# - $x_A$ is the molar fraction of component A
# - $f_A(T,P_1)$ is the fugacity of the _pure component A_ at temperature $T$ and pressure $P_1$
# 
# _In compartment 2_ we have instewad a pure component A liquid, at temperature $T$ and pressure $P_2$. The fugacity of component A in compartment 2 thus simply corresponds to the fugacity of the pure component A at $T$, $P_2$: 
# $$
# f_{A,2}=f_A(T,P_2)
# $$(eq:rightside)
# 
# __The Poynting correction__ In order to define a common reference state between the two compartments we rewrite fugacity of the pure component A at pressure $P_2$ ($f_A(T,P_2)$) as a function of the fugacity of the pure component A at pressure $P_1$ and of the pressure difference $(P_2-P_1)$.
# 
# To do that we express the difference in chemical potential $\Delta\mu_{P_1\rightarrow{P_2}}$ between pure liquid A at temperature $T$ and pressure $P_1$ and pure liquid A at temperature $T$ and pressure $P_2$: 
# 
# $$
# \Delta\mu_{P_1\rightarrow{P_2}}=\int_{T,P_1}^{T,P_2}d\mu=\int_{T,P_1}^{T,P_2}vdP=v(P_2-P_1)
# $$(eq1)
# 
# where: 
# 
# - the expression introduced for the definition of the $\Delta\mu$ is the Gibbs Duhem equation ($d{\mu}=-sdT+vdP$)
# - $v$ is the molar volume of the system
# 
# Using the definition of fugacity introduced earlier one can thus write: 
# 
# $$
# \Delta\mu_{P_1\rightarrow{P_2}}=RT\ln\frac{f_A(T,P_2)}{f_A(T,P_1)}=v(P_2-P_1)
# $$(eq2)
# 
# The fugacity of a pure A liquid at pressure $P_2$ can thus be written as: 
# 
# $$
# f_A(T,P_2)={f_A(T,P_1)}\left[\exp\left(\frac{v(P_2-P_1)}{RT}\right)\right]
# $$(eq3)
# 
# where the term $\left[\exp\left(\frac{v(P_2-P_1)}{RT}\right)\right]$ is the Poynting correction.

# ## 3.3 The Osmotic Pressure

# Given the definition of equilibrium conditions, the expressions of the fugacity of component A in the two compartments 1 and 2, and the Poynting correction given in the previous paragraph we can write:
# 
# $$
# \gamma_A(T,P_1,x_A)x_A f_A(T,P_1)={f_A(T,P_1)}\left[\exp\left(\frac{v(P_2-P_1)}{RT}\right)\right]
# $$(eq)
# 
# where $f_A(T,P_1)$ is the fugacity of the pure component A at pressure $P_1$, now appearing on both sides of the equation. 
# 
# We can thus divide both sides by $f_A(T,P_1)$ to obtain the expression: 
# 
# $$
# \gamma_A(T,P_1,x_A)x_A =\left[\exp\left(\frac{v(P_2-P_1)}{RT}\right)\right]
# $$(eq4)
# 
# Rearranging this expression one obtains: 
# 
# $$
# P_2-P_1=\frac{RT}{v}\ln\left({\gamma_A(T,P_1,x_A)x_A}\right)
# $$(eq5)
#  
#  Recalling that the Osmotic pressure $\pi=P_1-P_2$ we get: 
#  
# $$
# \pi=-\frac{RT}{v}\ln\left({\gamma_A(T,P_1,x_A)x_A}\right)
# $$(eq6)
# 
# This expression \textbf{relates the composition of compartment 1}, containing a mixture of components A and B (e.g NaCl in water),  \textbf{to the osmotic pressure} generated at equilibrium conditions when such compartment is in contact with a \textbf{semipermeable} membrane that has on the opposite side a compartment filled by pure component A liquid. 
# 
# Please note that in this expression $x_A$ is the molar fraction of the solvent (e.g. water). Since we are considering a binary system and from an engineering standpoint what is typically measured is the solute concentration we can rewrite the expression as follows: 
#   
# $$
# \pi=-\frac{RT}{v}\ln\left({\gamma_A(T,P_1,x_A)(1-x_B)}\right)
# $$(eq7)
# 
# Where now $x_B$ is the molar fraction of component $B$ (e.g. NaCl).
# When the solution in compartment 1 is diluted ($x_B$ small), $\gamma_A(T,P_1,x_A)\rightarrow{1}$,  $\ln{\left({(1-x_B)}\right)}\rightarrow{-x_B}$thus: 
# $$
# \pi=-\frac{RT}{v}\ln\left({(1-x_B)}\right)={RT\frac{x_B}{v}}\simeq{RTc_B}
# $$(eq8)
# 
# Where $c_B\simeq{x_B}v^{-1}$ is the molar concentration of component B, the solute.

# ### 3.3.1 Dependence of the Osmotic pressure on the composition of the system

# Note that the expression $\pi={RTc_B}$ is only valid for small molar fractions of component B, the solute.

# ## 3.4 Flux of the solvent suring Osmosis

# In osmosis the flux of the solvent (component A) through a membrane is driven by the difference between the $\Delta{P}=P_1-P_2$ across compartments and the osmotic pressure $\pi$: 
# 
# $$
# J_A=p_A\left( \Delta{P} - \pi \right)
# $$(eq9)
# 
# where $p_A$ is the permeability of the membrane with respect to component A. 
# 
# At equilibrium, when $\Delta{P}=\pi$ the net flux across compartments is null. Without adding any external pressure the spontaneous direction of the flux is from compartment 2 to compartment 1 ($J<0$).
# 
# If we add a pressure, such that $\Delta{P}>\pi$ we induce the opposite flux, from compartment 1 to compartment 2. This process is named reverse osmosis.
