# # 7. Equilibria in Ion Exchange Systems

# In ion exchange processes adsorption takes place through by exchanging the counterions bound to charged ligands immobilised on the stationary phase. 
# In the following examples the ligands are anionic and monovalent and are indicated with $R^-$. 

# ## 7.1 Monovalent, symmetric cation exchange. 

# Let us consider an ion exchange system in which the cations that are selectively displaced from the liquid phase are indicated as $A^+$, while the ligand counterions are indicated with $B^+$. 
# The ion exchange reaction considered can be written as:
# 
# $$
# A^+ + R^-B^+ + X^- \leftrightarrows B^+ + R^-A^+ + X^- \\
# $$
# 
# where $X^-$ are spectator anions. 
# 
# The isotherm in the case of an ion exchange process can be derived starting from the equilibrium constant for the ion exchange reaction. 
# If we indicate with $C_A$, $C_B$ the concentration of cations A and B in the fluid phase and with $n_A$, $n_B$ their respective concentration in the adsorbed phase. 
# 
# The equilibrtium constant is written as: 
# 
# $$
# K_{AB}=\frac{n_AC_B}{n_BC_A}
# $$(IEXeq1)
# 
# The concentration of surface ligands is related to the concentration in the adsorbed phase of cations $A^+$ and $B^+$ by the following expression: 
# 
# $$
# n_R=n_A+n_B
# $$(IEXeq2)
# 
# The total cationic concentration in the fluid phase $C_T$ is analogously defined as: 
# 
# $$
# C_T=C_A+C_B
# $$(IEXeq3)
# 
# hence the equilibrium constant becomes: 
# 
# $$
# K_{AB}=\frac{n_A(C_T-C_A)}{(n_R-n_A)C_A}
# $$(IEXeq4)
# 
# This expression can be manipulated to provide an explicit relation between the concetration in the adsorbed phase $n_A$, and the concentration in the fluid phase $C_A$, i.e. an isotherm for the ion exchange process:
# 
# $$
# n_A=\frac{n_RK_{AB}C_A}{C_T+C_A(K_{AB}-1)}
# $$(IEXeq5)
# 
# This expression can be further simplified by introducing the molar fractions in the adsorbed and fluid phases indicated with $y_A$ and $x_A$, respectively:
# 
# $$
# y_A=\frac{K_{AB}x_A}{1+x_A(K_{AB}-1)}
# $$(IEXeq6)

# The concentration of surface groups in the statrionary phase $n_R$ also plays a role in determining the amound adsorbed. In the following we report the concentration in the adsorbed phase, in equilibrium with an arbitrary molar fraction $x_A'$ in the fluid phase as a function of the affinity towards the stationary phase (captured by the equilibrium constant $K_{AB}$) and of the density of surface charged ligands $n_R$.

# ## 7.2 Example problem
# 
# An aqueous solution containing 10% by mass of NaCl and an unknown concentration of KCl exchanges cations with a stationary phase until reaching equilibrium. When equilibrated, the resin has 10.5% of sites occupied by sodium ions. The ion exchange equilibrium constant, KNa+/K+ , is equal to 10. 
# 
# a)	Write the ion exchange reaction describing the symmetric monovalent exchange taking place in the ion-exchange column. 			       
# b)	Compute the molar fraction of HNO3 in solution at equilibrium.	               
# c)	If a solution with the same composition, but containing KNO3 instead of NaNO3 
# (KK+/H+ =9.2) was equilibrated with the same resin, how do you expect the fraction of occupied resin sites to change?
