    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "An aqueous feed of 10000 kg h$^-1$, saturated with $BaCl_2$ at 100$^o$C, enters a crystallizer that can be simulated with the MSMPR model. The slurry leaves the crystallizer at 20$^o$C with crystals of the dihydrate. The crystallizer has a volume of 2.0 $m^3$. From laboratory experiments, the crystal growth rate is essentially constant at $4.0\\times{10^{-7}}$ m/s. The density of the dihydrate crystals is 3.097 g cm$^{-3}$. The density of an aqueous, saturated solution of barium chloride at 20$^o$C is 1.29 g cm$^{-3}$. The solubility of $BaCl_2$ is 58.3 g/100 g water at 100$^o$ C and 35.7 g/100 g water at 20$^o$ C. The molar mass of $BaCl_2$ is 208.27 g/mol, the the dihydrate, $BaCl_22H_2O$ has a molar mass of 244.31 g/mol. The density of the crystals is 3097 $kg/m^3$, the density of the solution in the crystallizer is 1279 $kg/m^3$ \n",
