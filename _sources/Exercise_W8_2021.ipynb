    "- Crystal polymorphs are defined as substances that are chemically identical but exist in more than one crystal form. A polymorphic transition is a reversible transition of a solid crystalline phase at a certain temperature and pressure (the inversion point) to another phase of the same chemical composition with a different crystal structure. \n",
    "For a monotropic system, plots of the solubility of the various polymorphs against temperature do not cross, meaning that different polymorphs always have different solubilities, and different stability.\n",
    "Solution of a crystal is favored if the energy of dissolution is greater than the lattice energy, i.e., by dissolving, a compound forms a more thermodynamically stable state. In that sense, if the solubility of a polymorph is greater, means that this polymorph is less stable in its\n",

    "From the equation above it can be seen than the lower is the solubility, the lower is the chemical potential and we know that the phase with the lowest chemical potential at any temperature is the most stable phase at that temperature.

    "An aqueous feed of 10000 kg h$^{-1}$, saturated with $BaCl_2$ at 100$^o$C, enters a crystallizer that can be simulated with the MSMPR model. The slurry leaves the crystallizer at 20$^o$C with crystals of the dihydrate. The crystallizer has a volume of 2.0 $m^3$. From laboratory experiments, the crystal growth rate is essentially constant at $4.0\\times{10^{-7}}$ m/s. The solubility of $BaCl_2$ is 58.3 g/100 g water at 100$^o$ C and 35.7 g/100 g water at 20$^o$ C. The molar mass of $BaCl_2$ is 208.27 g/mol, the the dihydrate, $BaCl_22H_2O$ has a molar mass of 244.31 g/mol. The density of the crystals is 3097 $kg/m^3$, the density of the solution in the crystallizer is 1279 $kg/m^3$ \n",
